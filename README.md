## Introduction
This project involves web scraping restaurant data from the Swiggy website for restaurants in Bengaluru. Using Python and Selenium, we collected data on restaurant names, locations, cuisines, prices, ratings, and reviews to analyze dining trends in the city.

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Collection**: Gather detailed information on Bengaluru restaurants from Swiggy.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Analyze the scraped data for trends in dining preferences, pricing, and popular cuisine types.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language for this project.
- **Selenium**: Automates web browsing and data extraction from dynamically loaded pages.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **BeautifulSoup**: (Optional) For additional HTML parsing if needed.

## Data Collected
The following information was extracted for each restaurant:
- **Name**: Restaurant name.
- **Location**: Area or neighborhood of the restaurant.
- **Cuisines**: Types of cuisines offered (e.g., Italian, Indian).
- **Price**: Average cost per meal.
- **Rating**: Average user rating.
- **Reviews**: Number of reviews.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Dynamic Content Loading**: Used `time.sleep()` to handle loading times, ensuring all data was visible before extraction.
2. **Paginated Results**: Implemented scrolling logic in Selenium to load additional results for more comprehensive data collection.

## Sample Code
Below is a basic setup code for initiating the scraping process:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import pandas as pd
import time

# Initialize WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # or webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://www.swiggy.com/')

# Add code to navigate, scroll, and extract data as per project requirements
# Example data extraction:
# restaurant_name = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, 'restaurant_name_class')
# location = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, 'location_class')
```

## Conclusion
This project successfully scraped detailed data on restaurants in Bengaluru from Swiggy, offering valuable insights into local dining preferences, price points, and popular cuisines. These findings can aid in understanding market trends and consumer choices in Bengaluru's restaurant industry.
